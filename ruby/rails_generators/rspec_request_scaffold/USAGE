Description:
    Creates a nice scaffold of tests for a request resource.
    It will automatically detect the available actions for the given model,
    and only include tests for those actions.

Example:
    bin/rails generate rspec_request_scaffold Thing

    This will create:
        spec/requests/things_spec.rb
